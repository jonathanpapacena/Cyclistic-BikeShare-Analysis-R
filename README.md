Scenario:

In this case study, I assume the role of a junior data analyst for the fictional bike-share company based in Chicago, Cyclistic. I work on the marketing analyst team and the director believes the company's future success will depend on maximizing the amount of annual memberships. My team wants to understand the differences in riding habits between annual members and casual users. My team will use the insights to design a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual bike riders into annual members. Before any strategy can be created and implemented, the Cyclistic executive team must approve the recommendations.
